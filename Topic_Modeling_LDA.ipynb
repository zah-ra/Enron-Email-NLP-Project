Please read and see if it accurately reflects the essence of what you want to communicate. My suggestion is that you take the time early one evening and maybe visit with Brent off site. Maybe over a cocktail. I'm sure you will be both serious and concerned What you are doing is giving Brent his year end review and basically asking him to fill in the details with actions over the next four to five months. 1) Brent has a great opportunity to take his leadership skills to the next level and by focusing and delivering these challenges he will solidify his core strengths in the eyes of others and most importantly himself. 2) You need for him to step up to the plate and fully support you by insuring that he will \\\"take care of the business, completely and totally.\\\" No hits to the P & L, zero tolerance for incompetency and complacency. You can not do what you need to do Globally without the trust and confidence in his performance Additionally he must identify and develop his successor. Get a covenant from Brent that his is fully committed to do the work Also let him know you fully support him and will continue to back him fully in this effort as long as he does his part and keeps you informed.

              "6872   4 questions and answers Q1: What are the main reasons for having a common currency Euro for the EU? Transactions of money and trade will less expensive because currency exchange cost will disappear. Saves the costs of hedging exchange rate risks (some monetary, others due to the drain on managerial attention) or the risks of not heding fixed but adjustable rates. Makes price differences more transparent across borders, which may increase trade. Economists do not fully understand why, but beyond the measurable effects of the effects I just mentioned, a common currency increases trade even more than these slightly lower transaction costs can explain. The process of qualifying for unification also required lower inflation and deficits, which many economists and politicians desired. The main arguments for monetary unifications were political, not economic, having to do with integrating Western Europe. Q2: Beside losing its monetary authority, what are the reasons that the UK does not want to join the Euro? I believe the Government has a different opinion than the public. What are these arguments? As you note, the economic reason is fear of losing control over domestic monetary policy. As with the decision to join, the UK's decision not to join was largely political, choosing NOT to unify as rapidly with Europe on monetary and lots of other matters (social charter that may regulate working conditions, etc.). Q3: In my notes, I wrote \"You don't get rich by exporting -- you get rich in the short run by importing.\" What do you mean? I said that unclearly. I should have said, \"You do not raise your standard of living by exporting; you raise it by importing.\" At the same time, exports are the price of imports, so you raise your grandkids' standard of living by exporting intsead of borrowing to pay for the imports. (Unless the imports are high-value investment goods...) Q4: I also wrote in my notes: \"Trade deficits and exchange rates can't be used to describe a country's prosperity.\" If trade deficits and exch. rates can't be used to describe prosperity, what is the best measure? At first GDP comes to mind, but in my day 2 notes, there are all sorts of reasons why GDP isn't a good measure, the most poignant one being: \"2 countries have the same GDP, but one country has twice as many people -- this country has lower per capita GDP, and is poorer than the first country.\" CRUX: is per capita GDP a good measure of prosperity? Per capita is a pretty good measure of prosperity and living standards. The list we gave are all the components of \"the good life\" it leaves out.

              "      <td>4 questions and answers Q1: What are the main reasons for having a common currency Euro for the EU? Transactions of money and trade will less expensive because currency exchange cost will disappear. Saves the costs of hedging exchange rate risks (some monetary, others due to the drain on managerial attention) or the risks of not heding fixed but adjustable rates. Makes price differences more transparent across borders, which may increase trade. Economists do not fully understand why, but beyond the measurable effects of the effects I just mentioned, a common currency increases trade even more than these slightly lower transaction costs can explain. The process of qualifying for unification also required lower inflation and deficits, which many economists and politicians desired. The main arguments for monetary unifications were political, not economic, having to do with integrating Western Europe. Q2: Beside losing its monetary authority, what are the reasons that the UK does not want to join the Euro? I believe the Government has a different opinion than the public. What are these arguments? As you note, the economic reason is fear of losing control over domestic monetary policy. As with the decision to join, the UK's decision not to join was largely political, choosing NOT to unify as rapidly with Europe on monetary and lots of other matters (social charter that may regulate working conditions, etc.). Q3: In my notes, I wrote \"You don't get rich by exporting -- you get rich in the short run by importing.\" What do you mean? I said that unclearly. I should have said, \"You do not raise your standard of living by exporting; you raise it by importing.\" At the same time, exports are the price of imports, so you raise your grandkids' standard of living by exporting intsead of borrowing to pay for the imports. (Unless the imports are high-value investment goods...) Q4: I also wrote in my notes: \"Trade deficits and exchange rates can't be used to describe a country's prosperity.\" If trade deficits and exch. rates can't be used to describe prosperity, what is the best measure? At first GDP comes to mind, but in my day 2 notes, there are all sorts of reasons why GDP isn't a good measure, the most poignant one being: \"2 countries have the same GDP, but one country has twice as many people -- this country has lower per capita GDP, and is poorer than the first country.\" CRUX: is per capita GDP a good measure of prosperity? Per capita is a pretty good measure of prosperity and living standards. The list we gave are all the components of \"the good life\" it leaves out. On average, rich nations have higher life expectancy, etc., so GDP per capita is not too misleading, but it clearly can be (as we pointed out). Thus, no single measure suffices, and a combination of measures can be useful.</td>\n",

Transactions of money and trade will less expensive because currency exchange cost will disappear. Saves the costs of hedging exchange rate risks (some monetary, others due to the drain on managerial attention) or the risks of not heding fixed but adjustable rates. Makes price differences more transparent across borders, which may increase trade. Economists do not fully understand why, but beyond the measurable effects of the effects I just mentioned, a common currency increases trade even more than these slightly lower transaction costs can explain. The process of qualifying for unification also required lower inflation and deficits, which many economists and politicians desired. The main arguments for monetary unifications were political, not economic, having to do with integrating Western Europe. Q2: Beside losing its monetary authority, what are the reasons that the UK does not want to join the Euro? I believe the Government has a different opinion than the public. What are these arguments? As you note, the economic reason is fear of losing control over domestic monetary policy. As with the decision to join, the UK's decision not to join was largely political, choosing NOT to unify as rapidly with Europe on monetary and lots of other matters (social charter that may regulate working conditions, etc.). Q3: In my notes, I wrote \\\"You don't get rich by exporting -- you get rich in the short run by importing.\\\" What do you mean? I said that unclearly. I should have said, \\\"You do not raise your standard of living by exporting; you raise it by importing.\\\" At the same time, exports are the price of imports, so you raise your grandkids' standard of living by exporting intsead of borrowing to pay for the imports. (Unless the imports are high-value investment goods...) Q4: I also wrote in my notes: \\\"Trade deficits and exchange rates can't be used to describe a country's prosperity.\\\" If trade deficits and exch. rates can't be used to describe prosperity, what is the best measure? At first GDP comes to mind, but in my day 2 notes, there are all sorts of reasons why GDP isn't a good measure, the most poignant one being: \\\"2 countries have the same GDP, but one country has twice as many people -- this country has lower per capita GDP, and is poorer than the first country.\\\" CRUX: is per capita GDP a good measure of prosperity? Per capita is a pretty good measure of prosperity and living standards. The list we gave are all the components of \\\"the good life\\\" it leaves out. On average, rich nations have higher life expectancy, etc., so GDP per capita is not too misleading, but it clearly can be (as we pointed out). Thus, no single measure suffices, and a combination of measures can be useful.\",\n          \"re: public hydro data sources Thanks for the information. It will be very useful to the team!

I/T Networks team will be connecting the new building network infrastructure located in Enron Center South (ECS) to the existing Enron Center North (ECN) backbone network. While this activity is not expected to produce a disruption to network services, this notice is designed to alert the organization to our activities. No network hardware or systems are anticipated to be shutdown. The actual physical interconnection of the networks will be performed in the EB 34th floor Data Center. Interconnection activities are scheduled to occur the evening of July 14, 2001 starting from 7:00 p.m.(CT) and completing around 11:00 p.m. (CT). Application testing activities will begin at 11:00 p.m. (CT) once all network testing has completed.

              "19004  re: elevator maintenance Gary, Yesterdays elevator problem was caused initially by a broken belt on the governor on Car # 21. This controls the speed of the car, and the car is designed to stop where it is if something happens to the governor rather than risk an overspeed condition. We have had the car thoroughly checked over today to see what else we could determine about yesterdays problems. The intercom in this car does not work, but the alarm bell does work. I can't explain why no one heard the bell. We have taken the car out of service until the intercom is repaired. There have been several changes within the Maintenance Department since the bankruptcy in December, but none that should have impacted the maintenance levels of the elevators. We have eliminated the 24 x 7 on site coverage by the Maintenance Department, and returned to an on call arrangement which we previously had until about a year ago. We had to reduce the size of our staff as did everyone else, and simply do not have enough people to adequately staff 24 x 7 any longer. We also had two full time Elevator Mechanics on site Monday through Friday during our peak. That, however, was when we had over 8,000 people in the building. During that time we had a lot of problems just because of the extremely heavy usage. Now that we have fewer than 3,000 people here, the usage does not warrant two full time mechanics, so we have cut back to one. The routine maintenance on the elevators is still accomplished on schedule by the one mechanic. Most of the other high rise buildings in town have either one or none. In the past the second mechanic was tied up with trouble calls which we have very few of now. While it is not required by code, we have always made it an internal practice to do a physical inspection of all of the elevators and test all of their functions on a weekly basis. This is generally accomplished by Security or Maintenance either on Friday or Saturday after hours, as you must recall them to the lobby to do this. The inspections were not completed this past Saturday. This would normally not be a significant issue, as routines are interrupted from time to time due to other occurring problems. Unfortunately this time it was significant. This past Sunday has pointed out several procedural issues that either need corrected or reviewed with our support personnel. I do not know what time it was determined that someone was stuck in the elevator, but Security contacted our on call person at approximately 11:45 A.M. The on call Tech then proceeded to the building arriving at about 12:25 P.M. Our person tried unsuccessfully to reset the elevator, and when that was not possible, he asked Security if Schindler was on their way. It was at that point the he learned that Schindler had not been contacted yet. Security then called Schindler at 12:37 p.m. and Schindler contacted their mechanic at 12:44 p.m. The Schindler tech arrived on site at 1:45 p.m. and had the person out of the elevator about 2:20 p.m. It is standing procedure for Security to contact Schindler immediately in the event of an entrapment. Failure to do this resulted in an extra hour before help arrived. I am reviewing procedures with the Security Supervisor to insure there are no delays in contacting the elevator service immediately in cases of an entrapment. We are also reviewing the routine inspection procedures on the elevators to insure that they are inspected weekly and taken out of service if the intercom does not work properly. Security will remain responsible for these inspections since they have people here at night. I sincerely regret the extreme inconvenience your employee went through yesterday, and I assure you we are taking every precaution to insure this does not happen again. Elevators will occasionally break, and there will occasionally be an entrapment, but 5 hours and no ability to communicate is not acceptable.   \n",

I can not make a faculty lunch that day -- it's my mother's birthday and she lives in Austin, so I have already committed to lunch with her. Just let me know the details on how soon you would like for me to arrive at the Alumni Center, and if there is anything else that I can do.   \n",

              "      <td>re: elevator maintenance Gary, Yesterdays elevator problem was caused initially by a broken belt on the governor on Car # 21. This controls the speed of the car, and the car is designed to stop where it is if something happens to the governor rather than risk an overspeed condition. We have had the car thoroughly checked over today to see what else we could determine about yesterdays problems. The intercom in this car does not work, but the alarm bell does work. I can't explain why no one heard the bell. We have taken the car out of service until the intercom is repaired. There have been several changes within the Maintenance Department since the bankruptcy in December, but none that should have impacted the maintenance levels of the elevators. We have eliminated the 24 x 7 on site coverage by the Maintenance Department, and returned to an on call arrangement which we previously had until about a year ago. We had to reduce the size of our staff as did everyone else, and simply do not have enough people to adequately staff 24 x 7 any longer. We also had two full time Elevator Mechanics on site Monday through Friday during our peak. That, however, was when we had over 8,000 people in the building. During that time we had a lot of problems just because of the extremely heavy usage. Now that we have fewer than 3,000 people here, the usage does not warrant two full time mechanics, so we have cut back to one. The routine maintenance on the elevators is still accomplished on schedule by the one mechanic. Most of the other high rise buildings in town have either one or none. In the past the second mechanic was tied up with trouble calls which we have very few of now. While it is not required by code, we have always made it an internal practice to do a physical inspection of all of the elevators and test all of their functions on a weekly basis. This is generally accomplished by Security or Maintenance either on Friday or Saturday after hours, as you must recall them to the lobby to do this. The inspections were not completed this past Saturday. This would normally not be a significant issue, as routines are interrupted from time to time due to other occurring problems. Unfortunately this time it was significant. This past Sunday has pointed out several procedural issues that either need corrected or reviewed with our support personnel. I do not know what time it was determined that someone was stuck in the elevator, but Security contacted our on call person at approximately 11:45 A.M. The on call Tech then proceeded to the building arriving at about 12:25 P.M. Our person tried unsuccessfully to reset the elevator, and when that was not possible, he asked Security if Schindler was on their way. It was at that point the he learned that Schindler had not been contacted yet. Security then called Schindler at 12:37 p.m. and Schindler contacted their mechanic at 12:44 p.m. The Schindler tech arrived on site at 1:45 p.m. and had the person out of the elevator about 2:20 p.m. It is standing procedure for Security to contact Schindler immediately in the event of an entrapment. Failure to do this resulted in an extra hour before help arrived. I am reviewing procedures with the Security Supervisor to insure there are no delays in contacting the elevator service immediately in cases of an entrapment. We are also reviewing the routine inspection procedures on the elevators to insure that they are inspected weekly and taken out of service if the intercom does not work properly. Security will remain responsible for these inspections since they have people here at night. I sincerely regret the extreme inconvenience your employee went through yesterday, and I assure you we are taking every precaution to insure this does not happen again. Elevators will occasionally break, and there will occasionally be an entrapment, but 5 hours and no ability to communicate is not acceptable.</td>\n",

This controls the speed of the car, and the car is designed to stop where it is if something happens to the governor rather than risk an overspeed condition. We have had the car thoroughly checked over today to see what else we could determine about yesterdays problems. The intercom in this car does not work, but the alarm bell does work. I can't explain why no one heard the bell. We have taken the car out of service until the intercom is repaired. There have been several changes within the Maintenance Department since the bankruptcy in December, but none that should have impacted the maintenance levels of the elevators. We have eliminated the 24 x 7 on site coverage by the Maintenance Department, and returned to an on call arrangement which we previously had until about a year ago. We had to reduce the size of our staff as did everyone else, and simply do not have enough people to adequately staff 24 x 7 any longer. We also had two full time Elevator Mechanics on site Monday through Friday during our peak. That, however, was when we had over 8,000 people in the building. During that time we had a lot of problems just because of the extremely heavy usage. Now that we have fewer than 3,000 people here, the usage does not warrant two full time mechanics, so we have cut back to one. The routine maintenance on the elevators is still accomplished on schedule by the one mechanic. Most of the other high rise buildings in town have either one or none. In the past the second mechanic was tied up with trouble calls which we have very few of now. While it is not required by code, we have always made it an internal practice to do a physical inspection of all of the elevators and test all of their functions on a weekly basis. This is generally accomplished by Security or Maintenance either on Friday or Saturday after hours, as you must recall them to the lobby to do this. The inspections were not completed this past Saturday. This would normally not be a significant issue, as routines are interrupted from time to time due to other occurring problems. Unfortunately this time it was significant. This past Sunday has pointed out several procedural issues that either need corrected or reviewed with our support personnel. I do not know what time it was determined that someone was stuck in the elevator, but Security contacted our on call person at approximately 11:45 A.M. The on call Tech then proceeded to the building arriving at about 12:25 P.M. Our person tried unsuccessfully to reset the elevator, and when that was not possible, he asked Security if Schindler was on their way. It was at that point the he learned that Schindler had not been contacted yet. Security then called Schindler at 12:37 p.m. and Schindler contacted their mechanic at 12:44 p.m. The Schindler tech arrived on site at 1:45 p.m. and had the person out of the elevator about 2:20 p.m. It is standing procedure for Security to contact Schindler immediately in the event of an entrapment. Failure to do this resulted in an extra hour before help arrived. I am reviewing procedures with the Security Supervisor to insure there are no delays in contacting the elevator service immediately in cases of an entrapment. We are also reviewing the routine inspection procedures on the elevators to insure that they are inspected weekly and taken out of service if the intercom does not work properly. Security will remain responsible for these inspections since they have people here at night. I sincerely regret the extreme inconvenience your employee went through yesterday, and I assure you we are taking every precaution to insure this does not happen again. Elevators will occasionally break, and there will occasionally be an entrapment, but 5 hours and no ability to communicate is not acceptable.\",\n          \"re: ut general presentation I will be at the presentation.

              "0  Hello - In order to cross one more item off of the enovate setup list, I would like to pursue the initial capital contribution required under the LLC agreement of $100,000 from each member. Although we do not have loan facilities in place or final cash management protocol, I believe the initial funding can still take place. If anyone has any other thoughts please let me know. If not, I would like to schedule the initial funding for Friday, October 6th. I believe that Mary Lynne will prepare the necessary vouchers and journal entries. I am assuming that Enron MW, L.L.C., as Member, will be funding enovate, L.L.C. Does ENA then fund Enron MW, L.L.C.? (Kay? Mary Lynne?) As an update - Peoples' Board meets next Wednesday, Oct. 4th to approve the risk management policy. Assuming approval, enovate will be free to transact with third parties. Therefore, depending on payment terms, money will begin flowing through the enovate account. Therefore, any loan docs and service agreements should be in place by the second week of October. Any thoughts, please let me know. Thanks, Gregg   \n",

Although we do not have loan facilities in place or final cash management protocol, I believe the initial funding can still take place. If anyone has any other thoughts please let me know. If not, I would like to schedule the initial funding for Friday, October 6th. I believe that Mary Lynne will prepare the necessary vouchers and journal entries. I am assuming that Enron MW, L.L.C., as Member, will be funding enovate, L.L.C. Does ENA then fund Enron MW, L.L.C.? (Kay? Mary Lynne?) As an update - Peoples' Board meets next Wednesday, Oct. 4th to approve the risk management policy. Assuming approval, enovate will be free to transact with third parties. Therefore, depending on payment terms, money will begin flowing through the enovate account. Therefore, any loan docs and service agreements should be in place by the second week of October. Any thoughts, please let me know. Thanks, Gregg</td>\n",

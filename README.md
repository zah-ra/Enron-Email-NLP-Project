# Enron-Email-NLP-Project
This work presents an end-to-end NLP pipeline for analyzing organizational emails using the Enron corpus. A cleaned 30,000-email subset supports three tasks: structural element classification, named entity recognition (NER), and topic modeling. Transformer models were fine-tuned, including MLM-based domain adaptation for NER. Latent Dirichlet Allocation was used to extract communication themes. The pipeline integrates all models into a unified service. Given a new email, it extracts metadata, segments structure, identifies entities, and assigns a topic. The final tabular output enables structured, interpretable analysis of corporate correspondence.

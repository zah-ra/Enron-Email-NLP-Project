              "315545  Hello - In order to cross one more item off of the enovate setup list, I \\nwould like to pursue the initial capital contribution required under the LLC \\nagreement of $100,000 from each member.  Although we do not have loan \\nfacilities in place or final cash management protocol, I believe the initial \\nfunding can still take place.  If anyone has any other thoughts please let me \\nknow.  If not, I would like to schedule the initial funding for Friday, \\nOctober 6th.  I believe that Mary Lynne will prepare the necessary vouchers \\nand journal entries.  I am assuming that Enron MW, L.L.C., as Member, will be \\nfunding enovate, L.L.C.  Does ENA then fund Enron MW, L.L.C.? (Kay? Mary \\nLynne?)  \\n\\nAs an update - Peoples' Board meets next Wednesday, Oct. 4th to approve the \\nrisk management policy.  Assuming approval, enovate will be free to transact \\nwith third parties.  Therefore, depending on payment terms, money will begin \\nflowing through the enovate account.  Therefore, any loan docs and service \\nagreements should be in place by the second week of October.\\n\\nAny thoughts, please let me know.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nGregg   \n",

              "315545  Hello - In order to cross one more item off of the enovate setup list, I \\nwould like to pursue the initial capital contribution required under the LLC \\nagreement of $100,000 from each member.  Although we do not have loan \\nfacilities in place or final cash management protocol, I believe the initial \\nfunding can still take place.  If anyone has any other thoughts please let me \\nknow.  If not, I would like to schedule the initial funding for Friday, \\nOctober 6th.  I believe that Mary Lynne will prepare the necessary vouchers \\nand journal entries.  I am assuming that Enron MW, L.L.C., as Member, will be \\nfunding enovate, L.L.C.  Does ENA then fund Enron MW, L.L.C.? (Kay? Mary \\nLynne?)  \\n\\nAs an update - Peoples' Board meets next Wednesday, Oct. 4th to approve the \\nrisk management policy.  Assuming approval, enovate will be free to transact \\nwith third parties.  Therefore, depending on payment terms, money will begin \\nflowing through the enovate account.  Therefore, any loan docs and service \\nagreements should be in place by the second week of October.\\n\\nAny thoughts, please let me know.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nGregg  \n",
